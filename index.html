<h2>Personal Information</h2>
<p>My name is Utsav Acharya. I am from Nepal. I have been in Australia since 2007. I work as a chef in a
restaurant. My hobbies Include running, watching movies, listening to music. I have a desire to learn and
explore new things in life. I love working for solutions for a problem and finding the answers. I have
good communication skills.</p>

<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
<p>I like computers. I love what computers can do and how they have changed the way we interact in this
world. We are surrounded by them. So, I have always wanted to learn how these machines work but I
was always afraid to take the necessary steps to gain the skills as I felt it is beyond my capabilities. But I
do want to give it a go before I really feel it is beyond me. I tried to do some courses in code academy
and other platform, and I learnt few java and python syntax but since I don’t use them in my day-to-day
life and all I knew was some syntax and methods but still didn’t understand how or why to use to solve
my day-to-day life problems. So, I have decided to take the courage to try to get a University degree in
RMIT. I want to learn how to program a software. I want to be able to read a code, be able to debug
them, write my own codes, build applications and algorithms. I want to know how this field of
Information Technology works.</p>

I have always been interested in the financial side of the technology. More importantly how technology
have affected how we do business. The rise of computers means we are not required to have physical
cash with us at any time we pay for goods and services. The position will allow me to work in the
industry I have always wanted and develop the necessary technology for banking and payments.
The job will require me to have strong skills in JAVA, Kotlin, Scala, Microservices, Spring Boot and AWS.I
currently possess some communication skills and know some JAVA syntax. I have so much to learn. I
plan to learn so much during this degree and may be study some more take other qualifications if
required. So first I want to be very proficient JAVA programmer, then whatever be next. First, I want to
learn one programming language and take the next necessary steps.</p>

<h3>Big Five Personality Test</h4>
  <img src="img/Capture1.png" alt="">

<p>I am friendly and optimistic about life but most of the time I keep it to myself. I like to be alone and work
on things that interest me. I am very much of a team player. I like to finish the tasks assigned to me, but
I am not particularly good at assigning task myself.</p>

<h2>Project Idea</h2>

<h3 class ="title">Build a smartphone application</h3>

<p>It is an application for all the personal finances like gas, electricity bills, fuel, groceries etc. It will help to
keep track of all the expenditure done on day-to-day basis. The application will be useful for budgeting
so, you can plan your holidays and trips accordingly.</p>

<p>This application will be useful for everybody. Every time to make a transaction put the details on the
application and everything will be for you to see at the end of month. It will be interesting for me to
build my first application as a budgeting application. I also want the application to get data for the stock
when you type in the name its traded on. It can later be built as an investment portfolio application
when the relative skills are acquired.
</p>

<p>The product will be an android application. It will be built using a programming language java. Java is the
language that is considered one of the most popular programming languages in the world according to
the stack overflow Developer survey with more than 40% working on the language. The application will
require for you to type in your username and password. After you are inside you can view your
expenditure list which include 1. groceries, 2. bills and utilities, 3. entertainment, 4. fuel, 5. others.
The first verion can be quite simple application which takes input from the user and stores values. This
application is something that has lot of potential. There is so much you can do with something like this
on your phone or even desktop. This application can be built something to connect all your finances
from your saving to investments. I know this kind of project will require me to have a lot of skills as a
programmer. But that is what I intent on doing over the course of my next few years. I really hope I can
do something like that, it will be amazing.<</p>

<p>I know it will be extremely hard for to learn something like that, but It is a skill many people have which
people like me do not. So, I believe I will be able to do things like that through studying this degree in
RMIT.</p>
